# UntitledRoguelikeGame
 An untitled roguelike game made using the Slick2D framework and rlforj library
# Info
 I began this project in July, while I wroted my own A* pathfinding and raycasting field of view algorithm, I decided to use what was provided by Slick2D and rlforj libray instead since it is more stable and efficient. As of the theme of the game, I haven't decided yet, for now I'll just focus on finishing the basic functionalities of the game.
 All graphical resource in this project are either resources from [dawnlike](https://opengameart.org/content/dawnlike-16x16-universal-rogue-like-tileset-v181) or default graphic resource from RPG Maker MV, I also drawn some myself but I'm not an artist so it won't be hard to tell which are drawn by me.
 Audio resources will have their source included in the a text file in the audio folder.
