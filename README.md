# UntitledRoguelikeGame
 An untitled roguelike game made using the [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) framework and [rlforj](https://github.com/kba/rlforj) library while using [dawnlike](https://opengameart.org/content/dawnlike-16x16-universal-rogue-like-tileset-v181) resources as a placeholder for my game graphics (*//todo: find/hire a pixel-art artist*).
# Info
 I began this project in July, while I wroted my own [A* pathfinding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_NVl6Qu47g) and [raycasting field of view](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjRwWOcNfAc), I decided to use what was provided by [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) and [rlforj](https://github.com/kba/rlforj) libray instead since it is more stable and efficient. As of the theme of the game, I haven't decided yet, for now I'll just focus on finishing the basic functionalities of the game.
 
 ### Graphics
 All graphical resource in this project are either resources from [dawnlike](https://opengameart.org/content/dawnlike-16x16-universal-rogue-like-tileset-v181) or default graphic resource from RPG Maker MV, I also drawn some myself but I'm not an artist so it won't be hard to tell which are drawn by me. These graphics are not final but put in as a placeholder until I either magically become a good artist or find one to team up with on this project.
 
 ### Audios
 Audio resources will have their source included in the a text file in the audio folder.
 
 ### Other files
 Most of the game data such as items, furnitures, creatures and skills will be stored in JSON file format.
